## Introduction

BOSS (Bar Order Support System) is used to place and save orders in bars or pubs. You can mark that the order has been delivered and that it has been paid for. Allows you to filter active orders. After the order has been completed and paid for, or at any other time, it can be deleted. 

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.
